Juicy red-cherry fruit and a compelling hint of caramel greet the palate, framed by elegant, fine tannins and a subtle minty tone in the background. Balanced and rewarding from start to finish, it has years ahead of it to develop further nuance. Enjoy 2022–2030.   \n",

It's made from mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, with handfuls of Merlot, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc blended in to good effect. The whole combines into layers of chocolate and graham cracker, dappled in vanilla and jam. Thick tannins suggest a swirl or two of the glass. The finish is all tobacco.   \n",

It also has excellent acidity. But the tannins are astringently strong, giving a numbing sting to the palate. This certainly needs time. Give it until 2022 and beyond.   \n",

Full bodied and densely structured, it unfurls in wisps of black licorice and clove on the lengthy finish.   \n",

Red-fruit driven, it's round and rich, with moderate tannin and cassis, clove and black pepper highlights.   \n",

It is medium to full bodied, framed by lots of fine-grained tannins and finishing with more dark fruit. It's a good wine to lay down and drink after 2019.   \n",
       "24                                                      From several vineyard sites and combining all five red Bordeaux varieties, this wine is fermented in stainless steel before it rests over two years in both French and American oak.

Flavors are deep and dark with tar, pencil shavings, dried blueberry, street asphalt and a strong umami character, still tightly wound at five years old.

The wood element is a little weighty at this point, but there's solid fruit to support it.   \n",
       "13108                                                                                                                              Blackberry and vanilla make for a sweet, syrupy bouquet. The fruit on the palate is nice—it's mostly cherry and cassis. The finish is potent and slightly tart. Now it's hard to assess, as it's short on dimensions. Could use some time to integrate its components.   \n",
       "13109                                                                                           Deep, pungent dark-berry aromas open this round, inviting cherry and raspberry flavored wine. Round and almost overly suave on the palate, it has ample black cherry, chocolate and toast flavors, and closes with a finish sporting dried fruits. The dry, talcum-like tannins allow for early drinking.   \n",
       "13110                                                                Offers a smooth, creamy mouthfeel and a red plum-fruit core, with caramel and tobacco accents. Aromas are of figs and Indian spices; one reviewer found the fruit a bit candied. This is a very good Cab, drinkable in the near term, though not one that necessarily merits such a lofty price tag. Finishes with bitter chocolate.   \n",
       "13111                                                                                                                                                          This ageable wine has sturdy tannins and is a shade too young to drink now. A few years of cellaring will open up the blackcurrant and olive flavors and soften the mouthfeel. If you must open it, try with a perfectly grilled lambchop.   \n",
       "13112                                                                                  A can't-miss Cabernet with a rich nose of blackberry, plum, coffee and oak. It's so dense that the cassis, wood, and coffee flavors come across as being tarry. The smooth, stylish finish is packed full of woodiness, licorice and fine tannins. Simply put, it's full of style and a whole lot of fun to drink.   \n",
       "13113                                                                                                              The nose here offers a real mixed bag: some funk, a little perfume, worn leather, even pepperoni and peanuts. The mouth blends flavors of black fruit with peppery spice and herbs. It may be a touch linear and tight, but the basics are definitely there. Overall a very good wine.   \n",
       "13114                                                                                                              An unmistakable meatiness marks the nose, and then there's some Middle Eastern spices like cumin and coriander. Earthy and full of black-fruit flavor, with oak pouring in late. Try to ignore the bulky young tannins; assume the wine will mature and find its stride down the road.   \n",
       "13115                                                                                                                         A beautifully balanced wine, framed in plush, ripe, velvety tannins and backed by lush, black cherry, plum, blackberry, spice, herb and chocolate flavors. Gloriously complex, seamless in its elegance, the wine is packed with charm and personality; long on the finish.   \n",
       "13116                        Thunder Mountain wines often display a lot of character and evoke strong responses from our tasters. This ultradark Cabernet is no exception, with its overt heavy toast and black-olive aromas and flavors, heavy extraction, and full, but somewhat astringent, mouthfeel. Through all this it remains compelling, if not presently accessible. Needs five to seven years.   \n",
       "13117    A solid effort from a dependable winery that used to be known for value, back before wine—especially Cabernet—prices exploded. It hits all the right notes, with black-currant aromas and flavors, herbal or bell-pepper notes and a fancy streak of mint, complexed with lots of new French oak. Dry and rich, it finishes with dusty tannins, suggesting aging possibilities. Best after 2003.   \n",
       "13118                                                         Very tasty and large in scale, it sports a huge nose of dark plum and heavy cedar, along with cinnamon and vanilla accents wrapped in very toasty oak. Very dark fruit with licorice shadings and an elegant, supple mouthfeel add to the appeal. The dark flavors and heavy toast continue on the long finish, which doesn't want to quit.   \n",
       "13119                                               A profoundly deep nose of red and black fruit, with cedar, ginger and nutmeg. The sense of balance and grace is sublime, as layers of cassis, plum and cinnamon keep unfolding. The chewy finish is lengthy and elegant, and it should be held for no less than five years. This bottling honors its pedigree as California's first classic Cabernet.   \n",
       "13120                                                              Full-priced, full-bodied, and the full complement of just about all you want in a Rutherford Cab. Port-like aromas lead a pure and layered palate that features cassis, cherry, tobacco and cocoa. What an array of flavors, and then it finishes with dusty tannins and a tight grip. The gang at BV sure know how to craft Cabernet.   \n",

A big wine needing some time to come together; it is stylish for sure, with a vivid, exciting finish.   \n",

Drinks very soft and velvety, almost too much so; seems to lack acidity and vibrancy. At this price, though, you can’t expect miracles.   \n",
       "13123                                                                                                                                                                                   Has the soft, easy but complex tannins that made the appellation famous, and bracing acidity underpinning blackberry, olive and herb flavors. Feels good and rich in the mouth. Try cellaring it for a few years.   \n",
       "13124                    Structured and built for the long haul, the densely packed aromatics hint at the power within. Blackberry, earth, fruitcake and cinnamon are all there, and the palate delivers a similar mix with added coffee, cocoa and licorice elements. Great texture and weight, and a lengthy finish with dry, even tannins. Best if cellared four to six years, and will keep for ages.   \n",
       "13125                                                                Defines what makes this appellation great for Cabernet, but also why it won't rival Napa anytime soon. Brilliantly ripe fruit, lovely balance, such a pretty taste of the earth and, in this case, expensive oak. But there's that extra something it aspires to and doesn't quite achieve. It has to do with complexity of tannins.   \n",

Dry, with good tannins and balance, but just can't break through a certain ceiling.   \n",

Dry, dusty and earthy, this wine shows solid fundamentals. The early line is for a strong future.   \n",
       "13128         Still dependable despite changes in ownership, this winery again delivers an elegant, well-made wine. With this vintage, it veers more toward herbaceous notes than fruity ones. The dominant flavors are of green olives and sweet bell pepper. Don't think, however, that it's lean. Oak provides fatness, and the right foods, like grilled red meat, will coax out the berry sweetness.   \n",

Medium-weight, with very nice fruit and good structure, it displays some engaging chocolate and spice notes. The finish is brisk and tangy, with bitter cocoa notes and firm, drying tannins. Hold until 2005.   \n",

Youthful tannins and acids frame juvenile, primary fruit flavors of blackberries, and oak has been tastefully applied. But the rich core of fruit, and overall balance, urge longterm aging for a good ten years.   \n",

It's class all the way from the elegant entry to the long, spicy finish. A hollow center says it won't age, but it's pretty nice stuff.   \n",

Packed with cassis, sage, plum, tobacco, earth and smoky oak, and perfectly dry and balanced. Sheer joy in the mouth, like liquid velvet. It changes every second, offering up tiers of flavors through the spicy finish.   \n",
